Singal Flow Analysis (SFA)
================================================

SFA is a simulation framework,
which provides useful data structures and functions
for efficiently analyzing signal flow in complex networks.

Features
--------
- Convenient data structures for analyzing multiple datasets with multiple algorithms.
- Support for visualizing simulation results and signal flow.
- Parallel simulations using multiprocessing.
- User-defined algorithms or datasets.
