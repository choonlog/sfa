Signal Flow Analysis (SFA)
==========================

A simulation framework to analyze signal flows in complex networks.

## Features ##
* Estimate the signal flow using only the network topology.
* Calculate the influence using only the network topology.
* Apply multiple algorithms to multiple datasets.
* Perform large-scale simulations with parallel processing.
* Suppoer user-defined algorithms and datasets.

## Python version ##
* Both Python 2 and 3 are supported.
* Some features such as parallel processing are supported only in the specific versions of Python.

## Documentation ##
